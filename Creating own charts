 you can develop own charts by using the helm create command:

## helm create deis-workflow

Now there is a chart in ./deis-workflow. You can edit it and create your own templates.

As you edit your chart, you can validate that it is well-formatted by running helm lint.

When itâ€™s time to package the chart up for distribution, you can run the helm package command:

## helm package deis-workflow

And that chart can now easily be installed by helm install:

## helm install ./deis-workflow-0.1.0.tgz

Charts that are archived can be loaded into chart repositories.
