 you can develop own charts by using the helm create command:

## helm create deis-workflow

Now there is a chart in ./deis-workflow. You can edit it and create your own templates.

As you edit your chart, you can validate that it is well-formatted by running helm lint.

When it’s time to package the chart up for distribution, you can run the helm package command:

## helm package deis-workflow

And that chart can now easily be installed by helm install:

## helm install ./deis-workflow-0.1.0.tgz

Charts that are archived can be loaded into chart repositories.

Helm has some tooling to create the scaffolding needed to start developing a new Helm Chart. 
We’ll create it with a placeholder name of helm:

$ helm create helm

Helm will have created a number of files and directories.

Chart.yaml - the metadata for your Helm Chart.
values.yaml - values that can be used as variables in your templates.
templates/*.yaml - Example Kubernetes manifests.
_helpers.tpl - helper functions that can be used inside the templates.
templates/NOTES.txt - templated notes that are displayed on Chart install.
