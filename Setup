Every release of Helm provides binary releases for a variety of OSes. These binary versions can be manually downloaded and installed.

Download your desired version (https://github.com/helm/helm/releases )
Unpack it (tar -zxvf helm-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.tgz)
Find the helm binary in the unpacked directory, and move it to its desired destination (mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm)
From there, you should be able to run the client: helm help

If a service account has not already been installed for Tiller, install one

kubectl apply -f helm/helm-service-account.yaml
