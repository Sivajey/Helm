You can see which charts are available by running 
 
## helm search
 
With no filter, helm search shows you all of the available charts. You can narrow down your results by searching with a filter

## helm search jenkins

We can use helm inspect chart to see the detailed information

## helm inspect stable/jenkins

Search is a good way to find available packages. Once you have found a package you want to install, 
you can use helm install to install it

To install a new package, use the helm install command. At its simplest, it takes only one argument: The name of the chart.
## helm install stable/jenkins

Now the jenkins chart is installed. Note that installing a chart creates a new release object. The release above is named yellow-owl. (If you want to use your own release name, simply use the --name flag on helm install.

To keep track of a releaseâ€™s state, or to re-read configuration information, you can use helm status
## helm stall yellow-owl
